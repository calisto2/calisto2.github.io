00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.124
I stay up too late

test
00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.020
Got nothing in my brain

3
00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:14.225
That’s what people say

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.014
That’s what people say

5
00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:19.976
I go on too many dates

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.887
But I can’t make them stay

7
00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.954
At least that’s what people say

8
00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.182
That’s what people say

9
00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:31.265
But I keep cruising

1
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.251
Can’t stop, won’t stop moving

1
00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:37.196
It’s like I got this music

1
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:41.593
In my mind, saying it’s gonna be alright

1
00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:44.627
Cause the players gonna play, play, play

1
00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:47.677
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate

1
00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:50.929
Baby I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake

1
00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:53.210
Shake it off

1
00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.744
Heart break is gonna break, break, break

1
00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:59.625
And I think it’s gonna fake, fake, fake

1
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.893
Baby I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake

2
00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:05.233
Shake it off, Shake it off

2
00:01:05.268 --> 00:01:08.019
I never miss a beat

2
00:01:08.054 --> 00:01:11.001
I’m lighting up my feet

2
00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.887
And that’s what they don’t see

2
00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:17.000
That’s what they don’t see

2
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.919
I’m dancing on my own

2
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:22.770
I make the moves as I go

2
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:26.088
And that’s what they don’t know

2
00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:29.176
That’s what they don’t know

2
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.356
But I keep cruising

3
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.300
Can’t stop, won’t stop moving

3
00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:37.698
It’s like I got this music

3
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:41.501
In my mind, saying it’s gonna be alright

3
00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.497
Cause the players gonna play, play, play

3
00:01:44.532 --> 00:01:47.649
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate

3
00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:50.944
Baby I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake

3
00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.097
Shake it off

3
00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:56.575
Heart break is gonna break, break, break

3
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.534
And I think it’s gonna fake, fake, fake

3
00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.738
Baby I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake

4
00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:18.101
Shake it off, Shake it off

4
00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:20.564
Hey, hey, hey

4
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.527
Just think while you been getting down and out about the liars

4
00:02:23.562 --> 00:02:25.478
And the dirty dirty cheats of the world

4
00:02:25.513 --> 00:02:29.057
You could have been getting down to this sick beat

4
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:32.538
My ex man brought his new girlfriend

4
00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:34.244
She’s like oh my god

4
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.700
But I’m just gonna shake

4
00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:38.586
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair

4
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:42.867
Won’t you come on over baby we could shake, shake

5
00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:47.769
Cause the players gonna play, play, play

5
00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:50.593
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate

5
00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.878
Baby I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake

5
00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:56.174
Shake it off. Shake it off

5
00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.688
Heart break is gonna break, break, break

00:02:59.723 --> 00:03:02.679
And I think it’s gonna fake, fake, fake

5
00:03:02.714 --> 00:03:05.765
Baby I’m just gonna shake, shake, shake

5
